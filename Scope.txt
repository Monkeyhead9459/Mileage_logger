Option 1:
ESP32 creates an access point that a program on the computer remote access to acquire gps data.
After each acquisition csv file is renamed with an increasing integer
Remote access computer compiles all raw gps data and breaks it down.

Useful data:
time period of each saved csv file??
distance per day
distance per month

Option 2:
ESP32 uploads data to cloud storage (AWS AmazonDynamoDB)  computer remote access to acquire gps data.
After each acquisition csv file is renamed with an increasing integer
Remote access computer compiles all raw gps data and breaks it down.

Useful data:
time period of each saved csv file??
distance per day
distance per month

RAP (Remote access program):
Python GUI (tinker, pyQt)
use boto3 to access AWS
use road api to find nearest road and track pathway or just use raw data
use distance and elevation api???
make csv for each day trip to displayable on google maps with total distance traveled
make csv for month logs and total distance traveled
